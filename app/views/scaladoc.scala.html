<h1>ScalaUtils' Scaladoc documentation</h1>

<p>
ScalaUtils is released as part of the <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/">ScalaTest</a> project. For every release of ScalaTest, there is a corresponding release of ScalaUtils with the same version number.
Thus if you use both ScalaUtils and ScalaTest, you should make sure the version numbers match.
</p>

<p>
ScalaUtils Scaladoc documentation is integrated with ScalaTest's documentation. The links on this page link to the
ScalaUtils portion of ScalaTest's Scaladoc documentation:
