<h1>Downloading ScalaUtils</h1>

<p>
<strong>ScalaUtils 2.0.RC3</strong> (for 2.10.0+) is available at
<a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/scalautils/">Sonatype OSS</a> Maven repository (which is mirrored on the
central Maven repository as well).

<p>
ScalaUtils is a small library of utilities released as part of the <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/">ScalaTest</a> project that are useful in production both code and tests.
For every release of ScalaTest, there is a corresponding release of ScalaUtils with the same version number.
Thus if you use both ScalaUtils and ScalaTest in the same project, you should make sure the version numbers match.
</p>

<p>
A copy of ScalaUtils is
included in <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/">ScalaTest</a>'s jar file, so if you are using ScalaTest as your test framework, you need not include a copy of ScalaUtils
in your test class path. If you want to use use ScalaUtils in your production code, or in your tests when using a test framework other
than ScalaTest, you'll need to add it explicitly to your class path. Here is the information for including ScalaUtils in your project:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>group id: org.scalautils</li>
    <li>artifact id: scalautils_2.10</li>
    <li>version: 2.0.RC3</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the code for your Maven POM:</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
&lt;dependency&gt;
&lt;groupId&gt;org.scalautils&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;scalautils_2.10&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;2.0.RC3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>

<p>
And for sbt, version 0.10 or higher (for Scala 2.10.0+):
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
    libraryDependencies += "org.scalautils" % "scalautils_2.10" % "2.0.RC3"
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively you can just download Jar files for the library and Scaladoc documentation by hand from Sonatype. The artifacts tagged with 2.10
can be used with any 2.10.x release.
Jar files are valid zip files, so to access the Scaladoc documentation just unzip the Jar file. The Scaladoc Jars
do not contain a top-level directory, however, so you should unzip them in an empty directory.
</p>

<p>
For Scala 2.10.x:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/scalautils/scalautils_2.10/2.0.RC3/scalautils_2.10-2.0.RC3.jar">Download ScalaUtils 2.0.RC3 Jar</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/scalautils/scalautils_2.10/2.0.RC3/scalautils_2.10-2.0.RC3-scaladoc.jar">Download ScalaUtils 2.0.RC3 Scaladoc documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you don't have it already, you'll also need Scala. You can use any 2.10 release, which you can get from here:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Download latest Scala release</a></li>
</ul>
